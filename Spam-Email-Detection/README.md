# Machine Learning Project: Spam Email Detection

This is a machine learning project using Python and various data science libraries to analyze and process email data for spam detection. The project implements a text classification system using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression.

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The implementation involves:

1. Data preprocessing and text analysis
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
3. Model development and training with Logistic Regression
4. Model evaluation and performance analysis
5. Results visualization and interpretation

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn 
```
